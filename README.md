# **Introduction**
Tesla's automated driving cars have revolutionized the way we perceive traffic sign detection. It's a marvel that evokes the fascination I have with machine learning and its real world applications. Traffic sign detection is an integral part of autonomous driving technology that ensures safety and regulation compliance. My curiosity led me to explore how a CNN could be implemented to detect and interpret traffic signs, using cutting-edge technologies such as TensorFlow and Keras. I also made use of other essential libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and SciKit-Learn, creating a comprehensive toolkit for traffic sign detection. The journey led me to develop three Jupyter notebooks, each serving a unique purpose: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Modeling, and Grad-CAM Visualization. The future of driving is here, and it's governed by the silent commands of traffic signs, interpreted by the brilliant minds of machines.
